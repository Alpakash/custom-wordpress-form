# Send mail with custom three step form #

## :page_facing_up: Description

This three step form is custom build with HTML and JavaScript. It sends the form data to the email with the wp_mail() function.
I made the form for a friends website, however I am not really happy with how I did write it. It's a bit messy, but it does the work. I will refactor the code soon.

## :computer: Used Technologies

- JavaScript
- PHP
- WordPress


## :heavy_check_mark: To-do ##

Once again I know the code is not written really efficient. The idea is for example to implement some arrays and loop through them.

1. Finish the form (need to add some more inputs in the form)
2. Refactor code
